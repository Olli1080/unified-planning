        This method takes an `AbstractProblem`, an operation_mode and optionally an integer

        The first one is a list of names of engines that are currently installed and that can
        solve the problem; the list is ordered following some performance criteria, where
        the first element is the best one.

        The second one is a list of Dict[str, Any] and represents the parameters of the planners
